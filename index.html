            <p>As the country approaches the 2024 General Elections, one leader who could be seen as
                one of the biggest challenges to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reign is Rahul Gandhi. Rahul's growing
                popularity was recently witnessed when he undertook a five-month-long Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari
                to Kashmir. The foot march, which was launched with an eye to revive the grand old party's flagging
                fortunes,covered 3,570 km and crossed 12 states and two Union Territories. During the march, the Indian
                National
                Congress won state assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh and an emphatic victory in Karnataka four
                months
                after the march.Rahul was also at the centre stage when he got disqualified as a member of the Lok Sabha
                on March 24,2023
                after a Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court in Gujarat’s Surat convicted and sentenced him for two-year
                imprisonment on charges of criminal defamation for comments he made about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
                surname. Before his disqualification as an MP, Rahul was critical of the ruling government in the
                parliament
                and raised Taking a cue from the success of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul has consistently been making
                attempts to meet common people on the streets, addressing young gatherings in universities and raising
                his voice against the Modi regime. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul was president of the party and
                led the Opposition campaign. But the Grand Old Party failed miserably in the elections winning only 52
                seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha. Rahul lost his home turf Amethi to BJP's Smriti Irani but won from
                Wayanad in Kerala. The son of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul had earlier appeared to be a
                reluctant entrant to politics like his father. He entered electoral politics in 2004. He was appointed
                as the party general secretary in 2007 and was elevated to vice president of the party in January 2013.

                Sonia
                Gandhi in December 2017. Despite everything, Rahul has clearly evolved as a leader and a lot will depend
                on
                how he drives the election campaign first in four states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and
                Telangana) and then for the 2024 General Elections to be most likely held in May-June Taking a cue from
